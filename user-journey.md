## User Journey

Alice and Bob met in college and fell in love. After graduation, Alice stayed in Boston, while Bob moved to Los Angeles for work. They promised each other that Alice would try to find a job in Los Angeles so they could reunite one day.

However, they soon realized that maintaining a long-distance relationship was much harder than they had imagined. When they were together, everything felt easy and loving - but when apart, their differences in communication styles led to frequent arguments. One day, Alice discovered Amimi and decided to give it a try.

She signed up and started chatting with Amimi about her relationship challenges. To her surprise, Amimi provided thoughtful feedback and emotional insights that helped her better understand her situation. Feeling encouraged, Alice suggested that Bob also try Amimi. The app even prompted them to pair their accounts so it could learn about their unique relationship dynamics and help them discover their shared communication patterns.

Bob signed up using the pairing code Alice sent him, and soon they were connected on Amimi.

Now, Alice and Bob could chat together with Amimi's assistance. Unlike chatting on WhatsApp, their conversations became more constructive and engaging. Amimi helped them brainstorm fun activities â€” like movies to watch, events to attend, gifts to exchange, or plans for their next visit. Because Amimi had learned about both of them, it could make personalized suggestions that fit their relationship perfectly. During phone calls, they could even @Amimi to join in brainstorming or offer guidance, as Amimi already understood their context.

One day, Alice felt uncomfortable talking with Bob. He was very busy, and she found herself feeling lost and uncertain - unsure of what she was even feeling and what she should do, let alone how to express it. Instead of messaging Bob directly or involving Amimi in their shared chat, she switched to a private chat with Amimi for emotional support and guidance. Through the conversation, Amimi helped her reflect, process her emotions, and regain clarity.

Later, when Alice felt ready, she reached out to Bob again. To her surprise, Bob had also been talking privately with Amimi. Because both had taken time to understand themselves and each other with Amimi's help, their next conversation about the argument was open, empathetic, and positive. It became a moment of real growth for their relationship - one that strengthened their bond and renewed their optimism for the future.
